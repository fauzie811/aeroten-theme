## Overview

Currently includes the "Steel Blue" accent colour theme from Windows 10 for window borders and buttons.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add more Gtk+ customizations (e.g. Chromium Gtk+ decorations support)
- [ ] Include a customizable program or installer that allows users to choose their accent colours, including light or dark theme detection to allow a dynamic change in text colour for legibility.
